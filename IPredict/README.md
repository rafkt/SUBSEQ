# IPredict, a sequence prediction Framework

Sequence prediction consists in predicting the next item(s) of a sequence of items, given a set of training sequences and a finite alphabet of items (symbols). This task has numerous applications such as web page prefetching, product recommendation, weather forecasting and stock market prediction.

### This frameworks has implementations for the following sequence predictors:
* Compact Prediction Tree (CPT) [1]
* Compact Prediction Tree Plus (CPT+) [2]
* First order Markov Chains (PPM) [3] 1
* Dependency Graph (DG) [4] 2
* All-k-Order Markov Chains (AKOM) [5] 3
* TDAG [6] 4
* LZ78 [7] 12

### Datasets

The following datasets are compatible with this framework and can be used to perform experiments with the proposed sequence prediction models.

**BMS** is a popular dataset in the field of association rule mining made
available for KDD CUP 2000. It contains web sessions from an e-commerce
website, encoded as sequences of integers, representing web pages. 
%(parse)

**FIFA** contains web sessions recorded on the 1998 FIFA World Cup Web site and holds over one million web page requests. Originally, the dataset is a set of individual
 requests containing metadata (e.g.  client id and time). We converted requests into sequences by grouping requests by users and splitting a sequence if there was a delay of more than an hour between two requests. Our final dataset is a random sample from the original dataset.
 
**SIGN** is a dense dataset with long sequences, containing 730 sequences of sign-language utterances transcripted from videos.

**KOSARAK** is a dataset containing web sessions from a Hungarian news portal available at http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data. It is the largest dataset used in our experimental evaluation.

**BIBLE** is the religious Christian set of books used in plain text as a flow of sentences. The prediction task consists in predicting the next character in a given sequence of characters. The book is split in sentences where each sentence is a sequence. This dataset is interesting since it has a small alphabet with only 75 distinct characters and it is based on natural language.
